<h3>A note on trees</h3>
Trees are a very common datastructure in computing. Abstract syntax trees, binary search trees, tries, file systems, etc... all tend to be trees.
My personal favorite, one which I end up working with on a daily basis, is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_stack">cactus stack/spaghetti stack.</a> 
It turns out that, thanks to indexes, this ends up mapping pretty well to a database, as each child contains information about the parent, but not the other way around 
(as you'd typically see in a file system). A graph database would probably be a bit more ideal, as the branches would store the associativity. You could also do an additional closure
table and store every parent-child and child-parent relationship so that all queries are just index scans, 
but I think that typically has a bit more maintenance and storage cost than a basic tree structure would in a database.

{% mark excerpt -%}
More than a few database systems support recursive queries in a few ways. You have your Common Table Expressions (CTE), suppored by SQL Server and Postgres, 
`CONNECT BY` statements with oracle, and I don't believe any sort of support exists in MySQL. So basically: <b>recursive queries aren't portable across different
systems</b>. Neither are stored procedures. But both are popular because they leverage shared memory in the database. Except that we can have shared memory too. 
We have SQL. More importantly, all of these RDBMSs have temporary tables that are more or less the same.

So first, we need our table with our nodes. You might have a ROOT node, with parent == null, or you won't have a root node, and all your first level objects are root. Either is fine,
for this example I'm having a ROOT node.

{%- endmark %}


    :::sql
    --Folder is something like this:
    insert into folder(pk,name) values (0,'ROOT');
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (1,'Folder1',0);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (2,'Folder2',0);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (3,'Folder3',0);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (4,'Folder1_1',1);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (5,'Folder1_2',1);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (6,'Folder2_1',2);
    insert into folder(pk,name,parent) values (7,'Folder3_1',3);


So, besides our DDL create/drop our temporary table, we have to do some operatiosn with the table, namely populate it. 

Since we have a root object, the easiest thing to do is to just throw that into the temporary table, with an added value 'lvl' of 0 to denote that it's at the root level. 

Next, we iteratively insert into the temporary table, incrementing lvl on the client side as we go, with the following query until it stops inserting rows. 
(In the query, this is denoted as :{x} or :{x+1}.)
The query uses the highest lvl of the temporary table for a half-join (IN) operation for the folder table.

    :::sql
    --Filetree looks like (pk,name,parent,lvl,path)
    insert into filetree 
      select child.folder pk, 
        child.name name,
        child.parent parent, 
        :{x+1} lvl, 
        (select path || '/' || name from filetree where pk = child.parent) fullpath, --not necessary
      from folder child 
      where child.parent in (select pk from filetree where lvl = :{x})

And you got your code, something like this right after the first insert:

    :::python
    i = 0
    while(curs.rowcount > 0):
      curs.execute(sqlstmt, x+1, x)
      i+=1

I'm not sure as to the performance of DDL and creating/dropping temporary tables across all database systems, but I was able to outperform Oracle's `CONNECT BY`
statement by 20% even with DDL statements for my use case. In addition to that, it was much more flexible than `CONNECT BY` because `CONNECT BY` doesn't like 
nested subqueries for it's start parameters. It's also more flexible, and I'm pretty sure it's more portable. In addition, I was able to sort my results as I 
went, and doing a 'select * from filetree' returned them in order in oracle.

Your final bit of code would actually be to populate a tree object from the results iteratively. There's different ways of doing this. 
You could sort by lvl, parent, name, and then descend into the results and backtrack. If you keep the fullpath you can sort by that too.
