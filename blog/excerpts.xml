                &lt;p&gt;More than a few database systems support recursive queries in a few ways. You have your Common Table Expressions (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;CTE&lt;/span&gt;), suppored by &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt; Server and Postgres, 
&lt;code&gt;CONNECT BY&lt;/code&gt; statements with oracle, and I don&amp;#8217;t believe any sort of support exists in MySQL. So basically: &lt;b&gt;recursive queries aren&amp;#8217;t portable across different
systems&lt;/b&gt;. Neither are stored procedures. But both are popular because they leverage shared memory in the database. Except that we can have shared memory too. 
We have &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;SQL&lt;/span&gt;. More importantly, all of these RDBMSs have temporary tables that are more or less the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, we need our table with our nodes. You might have a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ROOT&lt;/span&gt; node, with parent == null, or you won&amp;#8217;t have a root node, and all your first level objects are root. Either is fine,
for this example I&amp;#8217;m having a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ROOT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;node.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashed female,
not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the
&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;O.P.&lt;/span&gt; to the Prompt&amp;nbsp;Side.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;I went and dressed sadly. It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I
tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinner-jacket. I
sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it.
It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed
for the&amp;nbsp;breadline.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
