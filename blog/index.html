    <p>I&#8217;ve audited a few database courses at Stanford, so I&#8217;m more relatively familiar with paxos.
I&#8217;m also familiar with Google&#8217;s Chubby, having read the paper over a few times. My interest
in Chubby mostly comes from the fact that I work on software that is inherently &#8220;file-like&#8221;, 
what we call &#8220;DataCatalog&#8221; at <span class="caps">SLAC</span>. However, the DataCatalog is meant largely to be a 
virtual file system for datasets, with some convincing features like searching metadata.
One thing it doesn&#8217;t have, however, is a lock service. That used to not matter very much,
because all interaction with the DataCatalog was primarily local, with clients interacting
directly with the database. Going forward, however, science is rapidly decentralizing, and
the need to support remote clients means one thing: relying on port 80 and RESTful&nbsp;APIs.</p>
<p>So, going forward, I realized I needed some sort of locking mechanism. I was planning on 
going ahead and using ZooKeeper with this, and storing some sort of state, but I realized
what might be more useful was if there was a true ZooKeeper RESTful client. This wouldn&#8217;t 
only be useful for the DataCatalog RESTful server (for purposes of locking), but it 
would also be very useful for service discovery, job barriers,&nbsp;etc&#8230;</p>

    <p>More than a few database systems support recursive queries in a few ways. You have your Common Table Expressions (<span class="caps">CTE</span>), suppored by <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server and Postgres, 
<code>CONNECT BY</code> statements with oracle, and I don&#8217;t believe any sort of support exists in MySQL. So basically: <strong>recursive queries aren&#8217;t portable across different
systems</strong>. Neither are stored procedures. But both are popular because they leverage shared memory in the database. Except that we can have shared memory too. 
We have <span class="caps">SQL</span>. More importantly, all of these RDBMSs have temporary tables that are more or less the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>So first, we need our table with our nodes. You might have a <span class="caps">ROOT</span> node, with parent == null, or you won&#8217;t have a root node, and all your first level objects are root. Either is fine,
for this example I&#8217;m having a <span class="caps">ROOT</span>&nbsp;node.</p>
