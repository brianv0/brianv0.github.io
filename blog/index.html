    <p>More than a few database systems support recursive queries in a few ways. You have your Common Table Expressions (<span class="caps">CTE</span>), suppored by <span class="caps">SQL</span> Server and Postgres, 
<code>CONNECT BY</code> statements with oracle, and I don&#8217;t believe any sort of support exists in MySQL. So basically: <b>recursive queries aren&#8217;t portable across different
systems</b>. Neither are stored procedures. But both are popular because they leverage shared memory in the database. Except that we can have shared memory too. 
We have <span class="caps">SQL</span>. More importantly, all of these RDBMSs have temporary tables that are more or less the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>So first, we need our table with our nodes. You might have a <span class="caps">ROOT</span> node, with parent == null, or you won&#8217;t have a root node, and all your first level objects are root. Either is fine,
for this example I&#8217;m having a <span class="caps">ROOT</span>&nbsp;node.</p>

    <p>Lady Malvern was a hearty, happy, healthy, overpowering sort of dashed female,
not so very tall but making up for it by measuring about six feet from the
<span class="caps">O.P.</span> to the Prompt&nbsp;Side.</p>

    <p>To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about&nbsp;me.</p>

    <p>I went and dressed sadly. It will show you pretty well how pipped I was when I
tell you that I near as a toucher put on a white tie with a dinner-jacket. I
sallied out for a bit of food more to pass the time than because I wanted it.
It seemed brutal to be wading into the bill of fare with poor old Bicky headed
for the&nbsp;breadline.</p>
