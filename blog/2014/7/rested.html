  <div class="post-body">
    <p>I&#8217;ve audited a few database courses at Stanford, so I&#8217;m more relatively familiar with paxos.
I&#8217;m also familiar with Google&#8217;s Chubby, having read the paper over a few times. My interest
in Chubby mostly comes from the fact that I work on software that is inherently &#8220;file-like&#8221;, 
what we call &#8220;DataCatalog&#8221; at <span class="caps">SLAC</span>. However, the DataCatalog is meant largely to be a 
virtual file system for datasets, with some convincing features like searching metadata.
One thing it doesn&#8217;t have, however, is a lock service. That used to not matter very much,
because all interaction with the DataCatalog was primarily local, with clients interacting
directly with the database. Going forward, however, science is rapidly decentralizing, and
the need to support remote clients means one thing: relying on port 80 and RESTful&nbsp;APIs.</p>
<p>Going forward, I realized I needed some sort of locking mechanism. I was planning on 
going ahead and using ZooKeeper with this, and storing some sort of state, but I realized
what might be more useful was if there was a true ZooKeeper RESTful client. This wouldn&#8217;t 
only be useful for the DataCatalog RESTful server (for purposes of locking), but it 
would also be very useful for service discovery, job barriers,&nbsp;etc&#8230;</p>
<p>Of course, there exists <a href="https://github.com/coreos/etcd">etcd</a>, but it&#8217;s a very young
project, with core features being temporarily deprecated until they can nail the <span class="caps">API</span> down,
and I want something more solid. Also, it&#8217;s in Go. My boss has been using java since
before I could multiply, and Go has almost non-existent uptake in the greater scientific
community, so that&#8217;s a bit of a non-starter for me. I&#8217;m hoping to use Kafka on some 
projects to replace a lot of what we still use email for, among other things, 
and Kafka relies on ZooKeeper. So, if I end up using anything, it&#8217;s going to be&nbsp;ZooKeeper.</p>
<h2 id="restful-api">RESTful&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>?</h2>
<p>ZooKeeper does have a RESTful <span class="caps">API</span> in the contrib directory. It&#8217;s pretty okay for doing
things like listing nodes. It has no support for events, and it&#8217;s kind of strange how
sessions work, in the sense that it&#8217;s kind of magic, and not&nbsp;RESTful.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve been want is a more complete <span class="caps">REST</span> api, including long-polling for events,
optionally returning events events that have happened since from a given zxid when
supplied with the paths, enough information about the ZooKeeper session state
so the state can be represented, and a connection reestablished at any time. Basically,
create the connection, cache it on the server, send enough information about it&#8217;s state 
back to the <span class="caps">REST</span> client so that the session can be reestablished at any point in time, 
from any java container. In a sense, much more RESTful than what we can get currently.
In addition to that, you can query the &#8220;events&#8221; resource with any zxid and retrieve
the changes to any objects since then, or long-poll and wait for&nbsp;changes.</p>
<h3 id="semi-stateless-client">Semi-Stateless&nbsp;client</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, what I&#8217;d like isn&#8217;t so easy with the current ZooKeeper client. The
client&#8217;s ession state is splayed across four classes - <code>ZooKeeper</code>, <code>ClientCnxn</code>,
<code>ClientCnxnSocket</code>, and <code>ClientCnxnSocketNIO</code>. I&#8217;ve done some work of divorcing
these classes of local state, and created an <code>ClientCnxnState</code> class which now 
holds that information. The idea is that a representation of that class can be 
sent back to the client. This would probably be done via headers, and the client
would have the option of using only the ZooKeeper client session <span class="caps">ID</span>, in the case
that only basic usage was needed, or possibly using all of it. Other features this
new semi-stateless client would have is that pings are now optional, and controlled 
by <code>ClientCnxnState</code>. This makes a lot of sense for it&#8217;s use as a proxy, as you end
up with a 1:1 correspondence between the liveness of the <span class="caps">REST</span> client and the 
liveness of the ZooKeeper proxy (plus additional latency). So your client expiration
is a bit more predictable, I&nbsp;think.</p>
<p>Another features is a <code>disconnect</code> method. This just closes the socket, but does
not explicitly end the ZooKeeper session. In my opinion, this feature is missing 
from the current ZooKeeper client. Currently, you just basically have to kill the 
<span class="caps">JVM</span> or somehow hack in some code that closes the socket if you want to cleanly
exit your process, with the hope of reconnecting to the server with the same
session and&nbsp;password. </p>
<h3 id="watch-and-ephemeral-node-behavior">Watch and ephemeral node&nbsp;behavior</h3>
<p>Continuing on, even if you can disconnect, you still need to store your watches
somewhere and reconstruct all event handlers if you&nbsp;restart.</p>
<p>See, the way ZooKeeper works now is that watches on the server database are tightly 
coupled with the ServerCnxn object. So if a client disconnects the underlying <span class="caps">NIO</span>
connection, the watches are removed on the&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Again, for clarity: The watches are, in fact, not tied to the session. They are 
tied only to a connection. It is up to the client to set watches on a&nbsp;restart.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s no clean <span class="caps">API</span> for doing that if you&#8217;ve exited your process. I think the
way you&#8217;d need to go about doing that is to make sure to serialize your watcher to 
disk somehow, reestablish the watcher on <code>ZooKeeper</code> re-initialization, and make sure
you have some system flag&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>This  assumes that the connection has died, however. What if you don&#8217;t want to locally 
track all of your client watches, you just want to make sure the events hit your&nbsp;watcher?</p>
<p>Starting with the ZooKeeper 3.5, it may actually be possible to discover which watches
are set on the server for a connection that&#8217;s still alive. Currently, you need to store
that information locally. In a sense, what currently exists is a bit more RESTful, as
watches could be viewed as &#8220;cached&#8221; until the socket is closed. The client can, at any
time, <span class="caps">POST</span> to the server with a zxid and retrieve any changes since then. The slight
caveat of that is if you post multiple paths, you end up caching that watch until the 
socket is closed. But the added support is nice because you can potentially discover
a list of all watches that have been set, where as you must keep track of that
information locally&nbsp;currently.</p>
<p>Ephemeral nodes survive through disconnects, however. Their existence is determined 
solely by the lifetime of the session. When the server doesn&#8217;t hear from the client 
in the timeout range, it assumes the client is dead, removes the watches, and reaps
the session. This is pretty standard&nbsp;expected.</p>
<h2 id="other-alternatives">Other&nbsp;Alternatives</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s now a Curator <span class="caps">RPC</span> proxy based on thrift which should be in the next version
of Curator. Underneath, it still relies heavily on the current <code>ZooKeeper</code> client,
but overall it&#8217;s pretty tightly coupled to the Server, although I&#8217;m not so sure 
about session expiration behavior. Unfortunately, I really, really need something
I can just use over port 80, as a lot of batch farms (i.e. the grid) often allow 
only outgoing port 80 for security reasons, and that&#8217;s a use I&#8217;m targeting, as 
we do have batch jobs that occasionally need to coordinate across&nbsp;continents.</p>
<h2 id="code">Code?</h2>
<p>Still a work in progress. I&#8217;m borrowing heavily from the current RESTful contrib 
package as well as the ZooKeeper client implementation. Currently, it&#8217;s implemented
using Jersey 2.9+, targeting standalone with Grizzly but also the option to have it
run in a container (tomcat, etc..). It&#8217;s kind of messy right now, but I hope to get 
things tested and posted&nbsp;soon.</p>  </div>
